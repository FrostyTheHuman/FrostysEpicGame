# Frosty's Epic Game
My first ever game, documented.

I've been wanting to get into game development for a long time now, but I've never really bit the bullet on it. I've finally decided I'm going to at least make *something*, whether it's good or not depends on how things go. So far, (as of v0.0.1-alpha, lol) I'm having a lot of fun messing around with Unity. Don't expect any sort of game that's going to go above and beyond and break the standards of gaming or anything.
